# üéâ Fedha Enhancement Summary - Advanced Features Implementation

## üîê Biometric Authentication Improvements

### ‚úÖ **Auto-Enable by Default**
- **Issue Fixed**: Biometric lock was not working well
- **Solution**: Modified `BiometricAuthService` to auto-enable biometric authentication when available on device
- **Implementation**: 
  - Updated initialization to default `_isEnabled = true` if biometric is available
  - Added automatic setup prompt after first successful login
  - Enhanced `promptBiometricSetupIfNeeded()` in `AuthService` to actually enable biometric auth with user test

### ‚úÖ **Improved User Experience**
- Biometric authentication now prompts user to test their fingerprint/face before enabling
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Integrated with session management for better security

## üí∞ Financial Calculator Accuracy Fix

### ‚úÖ **Newton-Raphson Method Consistency**
- **Issue Fixed**: Interest rate solver was accurate, but payment calculator gave inconsistent results for reducing balance loans
- **Solution**: Enhanced `_calculateReducingBalancePayment()` method to use same mathematical approach as interest rate solver
- **Implementation**:
  - Added precision checks to avoid floating point errors
  - Applied same formula with higher precision calculation
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### ‚úÖ **Verification Tests**
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_payment_accuracy.dart`)
- Tests verify consistency between payment calculation and interest rate solving
- Multiple scenarios tested (different rates, amounts, terms)
- All tests now pass with <0.01% tolerance

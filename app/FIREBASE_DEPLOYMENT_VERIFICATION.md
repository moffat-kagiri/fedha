## 🔍 Quick Verification Checklist

### 1. GitHub Actions Deployment Status

**Check the CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Visit: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fedha/actions
- Look for the "Build and Deploy to Firebase App Distribution" workflow
- Ensure latest runs show ✅ green checkmarks
- Check the deployment logs for:
  ```
  ✅ Firestore rules deployment completed successfully!
  📊 Final deployment summary:
    ✅ Rules deployed: firestore.rules
    🎯 Target project: fedha-tracker
  ```

### 2. Firebase Console Verification

**Navigate to Firebase Console:**
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fedha-tracker

**Check Authentication Setup:**
- Navigate to: **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**
- Verify enabled providers:
  - ✅ Email/Password (Enabled)
  - ✅ Anonymous (Optional, if used)

**Check Firestore Database:**
- Navigate to: **Firestore Database** > **Data**
- Verify database exists in `southafrica-west1` region
- Should show database structure (may be empty initially)

**Check Firestore Security Rules:**
- Navigate to: **Firestore Database** > **Rules**
- Verify rules are deployed and show recent timestamp
- Rules should include authentication requirements:
  ```javascript
  rules_version = '2';
  service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
      // User profiles - users can only access their own data
      match /users/{userId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
      // ... more rules
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. App Configuration Verification

**Check Firebase Options:**
- File: `app/lib/firebase_options.dart`
- Verify correct project ID: `fedha-tracker`
- Verify correct app ID and other configuration

**Check Google Services:**
- File: `app/android/app/google-services.json`
- Verify project_id matches: `"fedha-tracker"`
- Verify package_name matches your app

### 4. Test Firebase Integration

**Run Firebase Setup Test:**
```bash
cd app
flutter test test/firebase_setup_test.dart
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All tests pass!
✅ Firebase is initialized successfully
✅ Firestore instance is accessible
✅ Authentication service is available
```

**Manual App Testing:**
1. Build and run the app: `flutter run`
2. Try to create a new account
3. Check Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
4. New user should appear in the list
5. Check Firestore Database > Data
6. User profile document should be created

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Rules Deployment Failed
**Symptoms:** GitHub Actions shows red ❌ for rules deployment

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firebase token in GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Verify `FIREBASE_TOKEN` exists and is valid
   
2. Regenerate Firebase token:
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   # Copy the new token to GitHub Secrets
   ```

### Authentication Not Working
**Symptoms:** App shows authentication errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `google-services.json` is correct
2. Check Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings
3. Verify authorized domains include your domain
4. Check `firebase_options.dart` has correct values

### Firestore Permission Denied
**Symptoms:** App can't read/write to Firestore

**Solutions:**
1. Check Firestore rules are deployed
2. Verify user is authenticated before Firestore operations
3. Check rules match your data structure
4. Test rules in Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules > Simulator

### App Build Failures
**Symptoms:** GitHub Actions build step fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check Flutter version compatibility
2. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` locally
3. Check for dependency conflicts in `pubspec.yaml`
4. Verify all Firebase dependencies are compatible

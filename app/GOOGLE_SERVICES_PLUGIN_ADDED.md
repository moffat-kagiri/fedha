# Google Services Plugin Added Successfully

## Changes Made

### 1. Project-level build.gradle.kts (`android/build.gradle.kts`)
Added Google Services plugin to the plugins block:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.3" apply false
}
```

### 2. App-level build.gradle.kts (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`)
Applied the Google Services plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("kotlin-android")
    id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")  // ← Added this line
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Download google-services.json**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → General
   - Download the `google-services.json` file for your Android app
   - Place it in: `android/app/google-services.json`

2. **Test the build**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

3. **Verify Firebase integration**:
   ```bash
   dart run test_firebase_integration.dart
   ```

## Status
✅ Google Services plugin added to both build files  
✅ No compilation errors detected  
⏳ Waiting for `google-services.json` file from Firebase Console  
⏳ Ready for testing once Firebase app is registered  

The Android project is now properly configured to use Firebase services!

# Android MinSDK Issue Fixed

## Problem
The build failed because Firebase Auth requires minimum SDK version 23, but the project was set to use SDK version 21.

**Error Message:**
```
uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be smaller than version 23 declared in library [com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:23.2.1]
```

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
Changed the minSdk version from Flutter's default (21) to 23:

**Before:**
```kotlin
minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion  // Was 21
```

**After:**
```kotlin
minSdk = 23  // Updated for Firebase Auth compatibility
```

## Firebase SDK Requirements

| Firebase Service | Minimum SDK Required |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Firebase Core | 19+ |
| Firebase Auth | **23+** |
| Firebase Firestore | 19+ |
| Firebase Storage | 19+ |
| Firebase Analytics | 19+ |
| Firebase Messaging | 19+ |
| Firebase Crashlytics | 19+ |

## Android Version Coverage

With `minSdk = 23`, your app will support:
- ✅ **Android 6.0 (API 23)** and above
- ✅ **~93% of active Android devices** (as of 2025)
- ✅ All modern Android features and security

Devices excluded:
- ❌ Android 5.0-5.1 (API 21-22) - ~2% of devices

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build again:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

2. **If successful, proceed with:**
   - Adding `google-services.json` file
   - Testing Firebase integration
   - Deploying to Firebase Hosting

## Build Configuration Status

✅ Google Services plugin configured  
✅ Firebase dependencies added  
✅ MinSDK updated to 23 for Firebase Auth compatibility  
✅ Ready for testing  

The Android build should now complete successfully without the SDK version error!

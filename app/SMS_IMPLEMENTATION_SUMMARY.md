# SMS Transaction Listener Implementation Summary

## Overview

The SMS transaction listener feature has been successfully implemented in the Fedha app. This feature captures financial SMS messages from banks and mobile money services, extracts transaction details, and presents them to users for review before adding to their financial records.

## Key Components

### 1. Native Android Implementation
- **SmsReaderPlugin.kt**: Implements the BroadcastReceiver to intercept SMS messages
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Contains SMS permissions and necessary configurations

### 2. Flutter Components
- **SmsListenerService**: Dart service that interfaces with native code, parses transactions
- **SMS Review Screen**: UI for reviewing captured transactions

### 3. Data Flow
1. SMS received → Native Android listener captures it
2. Flutter app receives SMS via method/event channel
3. SMS parsed to extract transaction details
4. Transaction stored as "pending" in Hive database
5. User reviews transaction in SMS Review Screen
6. User approves or rejects → Transaction moved to main storage or deleted

## Implementation Details

1. **Service Registration**:
   - Native SMS reader plugin registered in MainActivity.kt
   - SMS listener service initialized in main.dart

2. **Permission Handling**:
   - READ_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Runtime permission requests in SmsListenerService.dart

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Parses M-PESA, bank messages using regex
   - Extracts amount, transaction type, recipient/sender
   - Suggests categories based on message content

4. **Offline-First Architecture**:
   - Works without internet connection
   - Saves pending transactions locally with Hive
   - Synchronizes when connectivity restored

## Testing

Detailed testing instructions are available in `SMS_LISTENER_TESTING_GUIDE.md`. Key testing scenarios include:
- Real SMS reception
- Simulated SMS in debug mode
- Transaction approval workflow
- Transaction rejection workflow
- Transaction editing

## Limitations

- iOS does not support background SMS interception due to platform restrictions
- Some non-standard SMS formats may not be recognized
- Requires manual review of all transactions for security

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced regex patterns for more financial institutions
- Machine learning for better transaction categorization
- Better handling of transaction duplicates
- Scheduled background sync of approved transactions

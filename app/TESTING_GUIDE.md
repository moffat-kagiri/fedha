# Fedha App Testing Guide
## Date: June 21, 2025

### ðŸš¨ CURRENT ISSUES RESOLVED

Based on the device logs, I've identified and fixed several issues:

#### 1. âœ… Route Generation Error - FIXED
**Issue**: App was trying to navigate to "/edit_transaction_candidate" route that doesn't exist
**Fix**: Added onGenerateRoute handler in main.dart to gracefully handle obsolete routes

#### 2. ðŸ”§ SMS Permissions - NEEDS RUNTIME GRANT
**Issue**: SMS permissions declared but not granted at runtime
**Status**: Permissions are properly declared in AndroidManifest.xml
**Solution**: Grant permissions manually or through permission setup screen

#### 3. ðŸ”§ Backend Server - NEEDS TO BE STARTED
**Issue**: Connection timeouts to backend server
**Status**: Server is not running
**Solution**: Start Django backend server

#### 4. ðŸ”§ Notification Permissions - NEEDS RUNTIME GRANT
**Issue**: Notification permission not granted
**Status**: Permission declared but needs runtime grant
**Solution**: Grant permissions through Android settings

### ðŸ“± TESTING SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

#### Step 1: Start Backend Server
```bash
cd c:\GitHub\fedha\backend
python manage.py runserver 10.0.2.2:8000
```

#### Step 2: Grant Android Permissions
1. **SMS Permissions**:
   - Go to Android Settings > Apps > Fedha > Permissions
   - Grant "SMS" permission
   - Grant "Phone" permission

2. **Notification Permissions**:
   - Go to Android Settings > Apps > Fedha > Permissions  
   - Grant "Notifications" permission

#### Step 3: Test SMS Ingestion
1. Send a test SMS to the device with M-PESA format:
   ```
   TFK3MN5LS9 Confirmed. Ksh180.00 paid to Walkom Enterprises. on 20/6/25 at 1:29 PM.New M-PESA balance is Ksh2,616.14. Transaction cost, Ksh0.00.
   ```
2. Check if notification appears
3. Open app to see transaction candidates

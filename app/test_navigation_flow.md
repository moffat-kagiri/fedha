# Navigation Flow Test

## Current Flow (After Updates)
1. **App Launch** → `OnboardingScreen` (shows welcome screens)
2. **After Onboarding** → `SignInScreen` (shows login/create account options)
3. **Create Account** → `ProfileTypeSelectionScreen` (Business vs Personal)
4. **Select Profile Type** → `EnhancedProfileCreationScreen` (with profile type parameter)
5. **Profile Created** → Dashboard with enhanced auth

## Test Checklist
- [ ] Onboarding flows to SignIn (not ProfileType)

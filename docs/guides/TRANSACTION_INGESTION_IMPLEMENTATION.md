## Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Smart Text Recognition

1. **Navigate to Tools** → **Smart Text Detection**
2. **Review Privacy Policy** - Understand data handling practices
3. **Grant Permissions** - Allow SMS and contacts access when prompted
4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set active monitoring hours (optional)
   - Select contacts/apps to monitor (optional)
   - Choose notification preferences
5. **Start Monitoring** - Begin automatic transaction detection

### Using CSV Import

1. **Navigate to Tools** → **CSV Import**
2. **Review Format Guide** - Understand required columns and formatting
3. **Prepare CSV File**:
   - Required: Date, Description, Amount
   - Optional: Category, Type, Vendor
4. **Upload File** - Select CSV file from device
5. **Review Results** - Check validation and import statistics
6. **Fix Errors** - Address any validation issues if needed

### Reviewing Detected Transactions

1. **Navigate to Tools** → **Review Detected**
2. **Review Candidates**:
   - Check confidence scores (green = high, orange = medium, red = low)
   - Verify transaction details
   - View source SMS message
3. **Take Actions**:
   - **Confirm** - Accept transaction as-is
   - **Edit & Confirm** - Modify details before accepting
   - **Reject** - Dismiss false positive
4. **Bulk Operations** - Confirm or reject multiple transactions

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
SMS Message → Text Recognition → Transaction Candidate → User Review → Confirmed Transaction
CSV File → Column Mapping → Validation → Progress Tracking → Batch Import
```

### Privacy Architecture

```
Device SMS → On-Device NLP → Local Storage → User Confirmation → Local Database
```

### Storage

- **Transaction Candidates**: Hive box with automatic persistence
- **CSV Results**: In-memory processing with progress streaming
- **Settings**: Hive box for user preferences and permissions

## Development Features

### Test Transaction Ingestion Screen
- **Sample data creation** for testing workflows
- **Candidate management** for development
- **Direct access** to review screens
- **Data cleanup** utilities

## Dependencies Added

```yaml

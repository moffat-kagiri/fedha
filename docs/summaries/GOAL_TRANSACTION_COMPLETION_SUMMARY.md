## 🔄 **User Experience Flow**

### **Scenario: User Saves for Emergency Fund**

1. **Goal Setup** 📝
   - User creates "Emergency Fund" goal with $5000 target
   - System stores goal with target date and description

2. **Transaction Creation** 💰
   - User adds savings transaction: "Emergency fund monthly deposit"
   - System automatically suggests "Emergency Fund" goal
   - User confirms or selects different goal

3. **Automatic Processing** ⚡
   - Transaction amount added to goal progress
   - Goal completion percentage calculated
   - Dashboard and goal screens updated instantly

4. **Progress Tracking** 📊
   - Dashboard shows updated goal card with progress bar
   - Goal details screen shows contribution history
   - Statistics updated with daily targets and projections

5. **Completion** 🎯
   - When goal reaches 100%, status automatically changes to "Completed"
   - User sees visual completion indicators across the app
